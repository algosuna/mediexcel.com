# A template for mediexcel.com

This is a simple HTML template for MediExcel's website development. Feel free to use it in your own project and to contribute any changes to make this better.

## Contributing

Here’s how I usually go about proposing a change to repos:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to this `master` branch.

You can also use the web interface to make changes.
